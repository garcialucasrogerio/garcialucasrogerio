  <h2> Biography and hobbies </h2>
  My name is Lucas and I teach philosophy at public schools in the State of ParanÃ¡, Brazil.
  I'm currently finishing a master's degree in phylosophy, studying the function of boredom on Heidegger's ontology.
  
  One of my favorite hobbies is drink a lil bit of beer with my family and friends, and I also like a good barbecue in my backyard.</br>
  As you all can see, I don't have a good english, that's why I'm here too.
  A few months ago I started to teach a new subject, new including for me, and it has to do with programing languages.
